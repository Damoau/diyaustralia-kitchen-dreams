# Security Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive acceptance criteria that must be met before the security implementation is considered complete and ready for production deployment. Each criterion includes specific validation methods and success metrics.

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization (DoD-001)

- [x] 2FA bypass attempts logged and blocked

**Validation Method**:
```bash
# Test admin access without 2FA
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" /admin/dashboard
# Expected: 403 Forbidden - 2FA Required

# Test 2FA enforcement
POST /admin/enable-2fa -> QR code generation
